				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Technology has recently been replacing humans rapidly in our society. From cashiers being replaced by carts that scan your items at amazon fresh stores to Tesla's that will drive for you. People can now be replaced by lots of technology.  Although this can be a bad thing and cause people to lose their jobs, this advance in technology is also revolutionary. New technology mixed with artificial intelligence is a combination that can help society immensly. One example of these two working together is how scientists from the Minnesota fish and wildlife department used drones with thermal cameras to track a population of whitetail deer. They used the cameras to locate fawns to capture and to show how efficient the drones were compared to people. </p>

				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>The issues that invasive species are causing: 
<ul><li>Disrupt how ecosystem functions such as changing the way nutrients, energy, and water move through the system.</li>
<li>Consume more food or have a different diet than native animals which impacts the availability of food and resources for other species.</li>
<li>Directly contributes to climate change and as a result we’re losing millions of trees because of invasive pests.</li>
<li>Lack natural predators.</li>
<li>Spread diseases or cause allergic reactions.</li>
<li>Cause damages to trees, crops, and many other types of plants.</li></ul>

Invasive species can be a serious threat to local ecosystems. Without having any natural predators, their populations can expand and wipe out other species because they are on top of the food chain. There are many examples of invasive species taking over entire habitats and causing the extinction of native species in the area, and even the collapse of entire ecosystems. One of the most common ones is in the Florida Everglades, with Burmese pythons invading and destroying the native populations. Similarly, an example of invasive species we see in Pennsylvania is spotted lanternflies and it can be concerning because these lanternflies damages trees, crops, and other plants. It's important that we take action to prevent the spread of other invasive species to protect our environment and preserve the balance we have in our ecosystems. </p>

				<h2>Solutions</h2>
				<p>We propose using drones' technology to remotely, safely and efficiently monitor selected locations 24/7 for any invasive species and stealthily follow it to its nest giving an easy way to locate a large number of the invasive species at once. 

A good candidate for surveillance is the JOUAV model CW-30E, it has: 
<ul><li>Max flight time of 8 hours. </li>
<li>Max range of 200km. </li>
<li>Max flight speed of 90km/h. </li> 
<li>Max vertical height of 6km. </li>
<li>Built-in autonomous navigation system which lets it navigate complex terrain. </li>
<li>Thermal camera for night operation. </li>
<li>30x optical zoom at 1080p resolution. </li></ul>

However there is still a need to identify species captured by the drone, to cut out the human resources needed for that, Artificial Intelligence should also be used in conjunction with the drones to have a truly autonomous system that can survey and detect animal species 24/7.</p>

				<h2>Costs</h2>
				<p>In an email exchange with the manufacturer the approximate price for the JOUAV CW-30E is half a million dollars. 

<b>Initial cost: </b>

A JOUAV model CW-30E drone cost half a millions USD, we would need at least two so they can alternate while one is refueling. 

We don’t need to train a new AI from scratch with technique such as “Transfer Learning” we can take an already trained image recognition AI such as the ResNet50 and fine tune to it recognize any type of animal we want, thus the cost involves in fine-tuning the AI is neglectable.

Therefore the Initial cost is 1 millions USD.

<b>Upkeep cost:</b>

Using google cloud server with 1 Nvidia A100 GPU which can process 77 images per second which is more than enough for our 60fps camera, the cost to run the AI approximately 2,700 USD per month.

The drone is a gas/electric hybrid model, including in the gas cost the approximate cost would be 3,000 USD per month.</p>

				<h2>Expected Result</h2>
				<p>We expect the results of using drones compared to people to be very successful. Drones are a much more efficient way to conduct research in places that would be difficult for humans to reach. Using drones, we should be able to find an invasive species much faster and cheaper than having people go out into the field to do this research. A study done by the Minnesota fish and game commission did research using drones to track deer as I mentioned in the introduction. Their study showed that a crew of 4 people required 70% less effort than what they would have done if they had tracked the deer on foot. If we were to use this method to track an invasive species, we could help decrease the species in that area significantly. That would help the local wildlife rebound to numbers that they were before an invasive species was introduced.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>In many ecosystems, invasive species are being introduced into environments and wreaking havoc on the native species. In most cases it is impossible to remove them once they have been introduced because of their ability to quickly reproduce and the fact that they also don’t have any natural predators. People have tried to remove them, but it has never worked. Our method of using drones to track the invasive species will be revolutionary in fighting invasive species in local ecosystems. The use of drones will cut efficiency and costs down significantly as scientists are now able to identify and then get rid of invasive species. With our proposal, the fish and wildlife commission should be able to find invasive species in local ecosystems and then remove them. Our proposal is the most efficient and cost-effective way to do this because of the use of this advanced technology. When we help local habitats, we are helping heal the world around us. </p>
